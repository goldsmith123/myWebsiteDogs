                        <p>Roulette is a casino game named after the French word meaning little wheel. In each play of roulette, a croupier spins a roulette wheel in one direction, then rolls a ball in the opposite direction in a tilted circular track that surrounds the wheel.</p>

                        <p>Mathematically speaking, Roulette is impossible to beat and no system howeverso devised will ever overcome the house edge. However, by measuring the velocity of both ball and rotor (wheel), the drop of the ball from the outer rim onto the rotor and using a bell curve to give a fair estimate of prediction versus actual, we may have an opportunity to gain from this planetary motion game.</p>
                        <p>Any such possibility without doubt, must lay in technology. The use of such deviecs programmed with the necessary algorithms are not illegal in the UK and Europe. However if caught one can expect to receive an unpleasant banning from that club. The watchword then is caution. Bet sensibly, use the Kelly Criterion to calculate both capital and bet size. Never waver from that fact and who knows, you could be a winner!<p>
                        <p>Better still, sell your product as an app and if you are comfortable, use it and I asure you, there is nothing in life that will feel so sureal.<p>
                        <p>WARNING: Bet responsibly. Never bet more than you can afford to lose. If you feel you are losing control seek professional help from organisations such as 'Gamblers Anonymous'.<p>
