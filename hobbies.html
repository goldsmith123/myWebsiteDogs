                    <p>Blackjack is similar to the game 21 and was the most popular game in casinos until a few years ago.</p> 
                    <p>Unlike other casino games the cards in Blackjack to have a 'memory'. By tracking the cards as they are played and discarded, the composition of the remaining cards is changed. Using a simple fluctuating count of 2,3,4,5,6 as +1 and 8 as 0 and A,10,s -1 (inc. picture cards) as the cards are seen, the 'counter' can know when the remaining cards favour the player or the house. The higher the count the more favourable to the player and he should then place larger bets. The lower the count ( - or 0) the less favourable to the player and he should then make the minimum bet. Gains tend to be about 1% and a large capital is required as the player can expect extreme fluctuations.</p>
